---

## Overview

This repository contains a structured Phishing Email Detection & Awareness Assessment conducted as part of the Future Interns Cyber Security track.

The objective of this task was to analyze real-world phishing email samples, identify technical and social engineering indicators, classify risk levels, and develop practical awareness guidance for employees.

---

## Objective

- Analyze phishing email samples
- Identify authentication failures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Inspect sender domains and embedded links
- Classify email risk (Safe / Phishing)
- Provide prevention and awareness guidance

## Analysis Approach

1. Collected phishing email samples from public datasets  
2. Reviewed email headers (SPF/DKIM/DMARC where available)  
3. Inspected sender domains and embedded hyperlinks  
4. Identified phishing indicators (urgency, impersonation, mismatched domains)  
5. Classified each email as Safe or Phishing  
6. Documented findings and prevention guidelines
